# Neural Network from scratch

## Motivation

ML frameworks are great, beyond just great to be honest. All of them make life easier for a wide range of people from ones who want to break into this amazing field to come aboard to experience the power of NN and also people who are highly skilled in the field to write production models to solve real life problems. 
 
 Abstractions always comes with a price, some of the drawbacks of using neural network/machine learning framework is that some of the core concepts or the mechanism under the hood is hidden unless you want to explore them. So I am one among the people who likes to pop the hood and look inside. I will try my best to understand this wonderful technology which is changing the way problems are solved with data in the recent decade.
 

## Objective

This repo is targeted towards two things in mind: 
1. Understanding and learning neural networks from the lowest possible level with focus on math. (practically speaking, not to the assembly level)

2. Understand and implement Object oriented design to extend the modules created in this repo.


# What if?

Have you ever wondered why the equation is wx + b not xw + b or b + xw? 
I always love to find the reason behind the equations as I hated math in my highschool for the only reason that every equations have to be memorized. But not any more. lets see why it is specifically wx + b
